**Stalk Codeforces profiles**
CF stalker chrome extension imporve the codeforces profile webpage to include statistics of problem solved by time  by that user.User can select year in the first graph to see lowest and highest rating solved for month and by hovering over the bar it shows the tags and  and count of no of problem solved with that tag. In the second graph user can select month for which he want to  see  the day  wise chart , which tell no of problem solved on that day and there tags and user can select the day he wants to see what problem he solved on that day , if user has solved the same  problem twice on that day it will be shown only once.

## How does it works?
The extension runs entirely on the browser and communicates only with the [Codeforces API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp) to get the raw data.

It processes the raw data to create charts/graphs and lists.
